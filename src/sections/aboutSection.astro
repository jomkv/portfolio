                My journey in web development began in 2022 during my first year of college, 
                when I was tasked with creating a personal website. That project introduced me 
                to HTML and CSS, sparking my curiosity and passion for web development.

                From there, I delved deeper into JavaScript and its frameworks, eventually 
                discovering the MERN stack. I started by studying and applying it to mock 
                projects, which helped me build a solid foundation. After my first year of 
                college, I landed an internship where I utilized the MERN stack to contribute 
                to real-world projects, gaining invaluable experience and confidence.

                Since then, I{"'"}ve worked on personal projects to refine my skills and have 
                taken on freelance opportunities to help clients bring their ideas to life.
